# Todo:
- refactor code (index.js, tests, boardComputer.js, boardPlayer.js, buttons)
- ~~add a smarter computer~~ Add an even smarter computer (it now checks its neighbor tiles if it hits
- display text when a Ship sinks
- modal when a player wins w/ a New Game button
- different color for different ships when sunk
- Live Demo: https://espiritukarl.github.io/odin-battleship/

P.S. I know that the original Battleship is strictly turn by turn, but I prefer it if it would keep the same turn if you hit a ship.
